##Geosafari Clone

    There was a learning tool in the late 80s and early 90s that used a two-sided, laminated cards that fit into the front of the machine. The card was designed to have some kind of drawing in the middle with answers to questions lined up along the side corresponding with numbers that can be entered into a number pad. There’s a really great video on this by Technology Connections that describes the entire tool in great detail here. My idea revolves around creating a modern day version of this concept retaining a lot of the elements that it introduced to a web app format. It would consist of some kind of art asset in the middle with drag-and-droppable slots that can receive an answer. The Genki Study Resources website already provides a drag and drop feature that I can use, it would be a matter of designing interesting art assets and programming the arrangement to mimic Geosafari.

# Personas

## Pleasure/Travel Persona

    Gillian, age 28, is a financial accountant taking her first paid vacation off from work since she started to a foriegn country. She decided that Japan is a lovely tourist spot with a lot of cultural aspects that appeal to her like food, customs (clothing, activities, etc.), and the climate around this time is wonderful. She doesn’t have much experience traveling however and she doesn’t want to commit to learning an entire language at an advanced level just to get around for the basic necessities that she needs. She’s also heard word around the office that they may consider sending off an accountant for a client in Japan sometime after her trip and she can use this as an opportunity to prove she’d be a right pick for the job as a scheme to extend her vacation.

    Gillian is confident that she can pick up the essentials of a language if she uses some kind of learning tool as a crash course for what she needs to enjoy her time there. She is interested in using the Genki Study Resources website to learn what she needs because it provides a flash card style of learning based off of the most recommended textbook in the country “Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese.”
