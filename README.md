# げんき Study Resources

## Project Overview
げんき (Genki) Study Resources is an open source web app for studying the Japanese taught in [the げんき textbook](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en). 
It was originally created by [Seth Clydesdale](https://github.com/SethClydesdale) and this is a version being worked on by five Temple University students as part of a final project in one of our classes. 
It contains some of the content from each of the lessons in げんき including the vocab and grammar, but not the lessons themselves.
It is strictly a set of different types of practice quizzes (drag & drop, multiple choice, etc.) and other exercises. 
Thus, it is merely meant as a supplemental tool for practice alongside the textbook itself, it is not meant to be used as a sole resource for learning Japanese. 
Our aim in making this version is to add games and a leaderboard system to the app in order to make it more enjoyable and add an element of competition to studying Japanese!
