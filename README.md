## Project Overview

げんき (Genki) Study Resources is an open source web app for studying the Japanese taught in [the げんき textbook](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en).
It was originally created by [Seth Clydesdale](https://github.com/SethClydesdale) and this is a version being worked on by five Temple University students as part of a final project in one of our classes.
It contains some of the content from each of the lessons in げんき including the vocab and grammar, but not the lessons themselves.
It is strictly a set of different types of practice quizzes (drag & drop, multiple choice, etc.) and other exercises.
Thus, it is merely meant as a supplemental tool for practice alongside the textbook itself, it is not meant to be used as a sole resource for learning Japanese.
Our aim in making this version is to add games and a leaderboard system to the app in order to make it more enjoyable and add an element of competition to studying Japanese!

## Vision

## Personas

### Jake

Jake, age 20, is a junior computer science student at a university in Philadelphia.
He has always had an interest in Japan, having watched plenty of anime and played video games that were developed in Japan.
Finally a young adult, Jake has become an intern software engineer at a fairly large company with offices around the world, and he was given the oppurtunity to work for that very company in Tokyo for an entire summer, all expenses paid.
Jake is excited to take full advantage of this oppurtunity, but realizes that he has to learn Japanese to some degree in order to survive living and working there for three months.
He has pushed off learning the language seriously for some time, but he is ready to commit to it and needs a place to start so he signs up for a Japanese class at university and starts studying the げんき textbook.  

Jake starts off strong, but after some time the same old quizzes in class and flash cards on Quizlet are getting boring.
He imagines that if he could use a simple game to memorize kanji and vocab, that he might be able to maintain the same enthusiasm and motivation that he had when he first started.
He is also incredibly competitive. If he is not at the top, he will work his hardest to get there. Because of this, he believes if there is also a leaderboard for this game, he will be even more motivated.
Since he is also a computer science student, Jake is incredibly critical of poorly designed apps.
He cannot stand many of the Japanese learning apps that are out there and have attempted doing something like this.
Thus, Jake is extremely interested in using げんき Study Resources' games and other tools to aid in his journey of learning Japanese.
